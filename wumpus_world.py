# WumpusWorld
# A simulated representation of a real Wumpus World, aligned with the specified
# characteristics in the AIMA text.
# Note: This is not a state model. It _is_ the real world / environment within
# which the agent operates. Think of it as actual, physical, reality.
# Note 2: This simulation will not include the modeling of time, for the sake of
# simplicity. This only affects the 'Bump' and 'Scream' percepts. In the case of
# 'Bump', we assume that when an agent is in a room facing a wall, it should receive
# the 'Bump' percept. For 'Scream', when the wumpus is killed we let the scream
# linger throughout the cave indefinitely.
